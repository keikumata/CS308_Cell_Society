I chose to remove the  int[][] tempMap = MapCopier.copyOfArray(map); code from all four of the subclasses since
they seem to be common in all of them. However the struggle my partner and I had was the fact that the Sim class is abstract.
We had made the nextGen() method abstract, which meant that there was nothing in it. This required the duplicate code of
 int[][] tempMap = MapCopier.copyOfArray(map); in every one of the simulations. However, we figured that this was a good sacrifice,
 as the abstract method in the abstract class allowed for the subclasses to all have this common method. Even if we had not done that,
 we would have had to do super(...) in every subclass anyway, which would have been duplicated code.
